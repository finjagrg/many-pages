          They say home is the place where your heart is Then I am home now,
          though I am far away For so long I've let the forest guard it And now
          it's begging me to stay And I'm trying my best to be tough To pretend
          I am strong and can siphon it off But I'm not who I wanted to be In my
          heart I belong in a house by the sea

          They say home is a place where you're needed Then I am home now, but I
          am leaving To feel my feet being kissed by the seaweed And I'll be
          silent and kiss it back This is not who I want you to see It's just
          adding on weight to the darkness in me And from the little I have
          understood I believe that a house by the sea would do good
